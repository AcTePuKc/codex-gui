# Contributing to Codex-GUI

Thanks for your interest in contributing to **Codex-GUI** - a PySide6-powered frontend for OpenAI's Codex CLI!

We welcome contributions from devs, designers, testers, and idea people alike.

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Fork + Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/codex-gui
cd codex-gui
````

### 2. Set Up the Environment

We use [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for fast Python environment management. To install:

```bash
pip install uv
uv venv
uv pip install -r requirements.uv.in
```

> You can also use `conda` or `micromamba`, but `uv` is the primary method.

Optional: use `run_uv.bat` or `run_uv.sh` to automatically configure a new environment.

### 3. Run the App

```bash
uv pip install -e .
./run.sh  # Windows: run.bat
```

## Codebase Layout

- The **CLI** lives at the root of the repository and is implemented in TypeScript.
- The **GUI** lives inside `gui_pyside6/` and is implemented using Python + PySide6.
- These are related but separate projects. Avoid mixing dependencies or logic between them.
- Only run `pnpm run build` if you're modifying the TypeScript CLI.

GUI and CLI are loosely coupled via the Codex backend engine. You can develop either in isolation.
- The GUI uses the CLI as a backend service, so you can run the GUI without needing to run the CLI separately.
- The CLI is primarily used for command-line interactions, while the GUI provides a user-friendly interface.

## Restricted Directories

The `codex-cli/` and `codex-rs/` folders are synchronized mirrors of external
projects. Avoid modifying files in these directories unless the maintainer
explicitly requests it. See the repository root [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) for the
full contribution rules.

---

## Development Notes

* **Core Code Style**: Python 3.10+, Black + Ruff (auto-format coming soon)
* **UI**: PySide6, signal-slot based, stateless where possible
* **Tests**: Coming soon - for now, test manually via GUI

### Naming

* Use lowercase `snake_case` for files & functions.
* Capitalized `PascalCase` for classes and PySide widgets.
* Prefix agent/system files with `agent_` or `sys_` if needed.

---

## Adding New Agents

1. Use **Agents -> New Agent** in the GUI to launch the editor, or copy an existing JSON in `resources/agents/`.
2. Update `name`, `description`, and `system_prompt` plus any optional fields.
3. The editor saves directly under `resources/agents/` and `Agent Manager` reloads the list automatically.

---

## Testing Code Execution

All test files generated by Codex are saved under:

```
tools/
```

They can be executed within a `uv` or Conda sandbox if enabled in settings. Execution output will be shown in a debug console (planned).

---

## Commit Conventions (WIP)

Use short prefixes for commit messages:

* `feat:` - new feature
* `fix:` - bug fix
* `refactor:` - structural change
* `docs:` - documentation only
* `test:` - adding or fixing tests

Examples:

```
feat: add agent dropdown menu
fix: handle empty input in prompt box
docs: update contributing.md with uv setup
```
